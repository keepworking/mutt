Announcing Mutt 0.91
====================

NOTE: PLEASE read the following list of changes carefully, especially the
first couple entries related to changes in variables/commands and see the
manual before posting questions.  Taking a little time to read this notice
will significantly reduce the amount of confusion as to why some things
might seem broken at first.

Major changes since 0.89.1:

- The matching for the send-hook, save-hook and fcc-hook commands has been
  extended so that it understands Mutt's matching language (used for
  searching and limits).  You may still use a "simple" regular expression,
  but Mutt will expand that with the value of $default_hook (similar to
  $simple_search).  Additionally, all hooks are now executed in the order
  they appear in your .muttrc instead of first doing `to', then `cc'.

- new config command `score' which allows you to assign a numerical value to
  a message based upon header information (similar to scoring in slrn).  the
  score can be displed in $hdr_format with %N, you can sort by `score' and
  you can match messages with a certain score (or range) with the `~n'
  operator

- new variable $beep_new which causes Mutt to beep when new mail is
  delivered to a mailbox specified by the `mailboxes' command

- new sort method `to' for sorting by who messages are addressed to

- new variable $meta_key which causes Mutt to interpet keystrokes with the
  hi bit set as ESC plus the key with the hi bit stripped (eg.  ALT-x will
  get interpetted as "\ex")

- new variable $sort_alias which controls the order the aliases appear in
  the menu (may be either "alias" or "address")

- new variable $alias_format to control the way the aliases are displayed in
  the alias menu

- additional operators to the pattern matching lanauge:
	~S		superseded messages
	~E		expired messages
	~p		personal mail (finds $alternates in to: or cc:)
	~P		mail from you (finds $alternates in from: or sender:)
	~l		list mail (finds `lists' in to: or cc:)
	~L<pattern>	finds <pattern> in to:, cc:, from: or sender:
	~C<pattern>	finds <pattern> in to: or cc:

- additional formats for $hdr_format
	%N	displays the message score
	%(fmt)	displayes the message's received time using strftime()

- additional formats for $status_format
	%P	percentage of menu seen
	%S	current value of $sort_aux (%s no longer displays $sort_aux)
	%o	number of old messages
	%u	number of unread messages

- new configure option `--enable-exact-address' which causes Mutt to rewrite
  addresses in the same format they were parsed instead of rewriting them in
  the form `Name <user@host>'

- new command line argument `-e' which allows you to specify configuration
  commands to be executed *after* your .muttrc is parsed
  (eg.  mutt -e 'set edit_hdrs' mutt-dev)

- you can now use `mono <object> normal' to set to normal attribute

- new function `search-opposite' which searches for the current search
  pattern in the opposition direction from the previous search
