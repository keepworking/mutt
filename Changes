Changes since 0.92.7
--------------------

- [patch-0.92.7.handler.empty_cc_bcc.1] fixed bug in edit_envelope() which
  caused the message to be aborted if the cc or bcc field was empty

- buffer used to store the error message in mutt_pattern_comp() called
  sizeof() on the wrong variable

- renamed $header_format to $index_format ($hdr_format is still accepted)

- [patch-0.92.7.vikas.postpone.1] fixed typo for binding the `postpone'
  menu, and changes the menu to use $index_format for display of postponed
  messages

- mutt_error() is now a function pointer which either has the value of
  mutt_curses_error() or mutt_nocurses_error() which simplifies the muttrc
  parsing code

- "source '~/bin/myscript|'" was fixed so that it works correctly

- [patch-0.92.7.me.mh_sync.1] fixed bug where syncing mh mailboxes silently
  failed

- [patch-0.92.7.me.pattern.1] fixes bug with mismatched backtics in the
  pattern language

- mutt_default_from() no longer sets the "real name" portion of the return
  address so that it can be delayed until after execution of send-hook
  commands
